## **Overview**
This project demonstrates how to implement a multilingual solution using AWS services. It allows users to:  
- Convert audio files into text using **Amazon Transcribe**.  
- Translate the transcribed text into another language using **Amazon Translate**.  
- Generate natural-sounding speech from the translated text using **Amazon Polly**.

## **Features**
- **Speech-to-Text Conversion:**  
  Uses Amazon Transcribe to generate accurate transcriptions of audio files.  
- **Text Translation:**  
  Supports over 75 languages through Amazon Translate with Neural Machine Translation.  
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion:**  
  Generates lifelike speech output using Amazon Polly's neural text-to-speech (TTS) voices.  
- **Real-Time and Batch Processing:**  
  Flexible processing for both real-time data streams and stored files.  
- **Custom Lexicons and SSML Support:**  
  Customize speech patterns and pronunciation for specialized use cases.

## **Usage**
1. Upload your audio file to an S3 bucket.  
2. Configure the script to specify the input language and target translation language.  
3. Run the script to process the file through the pipeline:  
   - Speech-to-text transcription  
   - Translation  
   - Text-to-speech synthesis  

4. Download the output audio file from the S3 bucket.
